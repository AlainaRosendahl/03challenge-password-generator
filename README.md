A password generator software offers a good display of all your credentials. As such, it saves you from memorizing hundreds of passwords except the generator's login details. The primary objective of using a genrator is creation of strong and unpredictable passwords for all of your accounts. If you need to create a single secure password or several passwords at a time, then a password generator is definitely worth using. Password generators tend to create lengthy passwords.
